#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Canonical test runner for hermes-agent. Run this instead of calling
# `pytest` directly to guarantee your local run matches CI behavior.
#
# What this script enforces:
#   * Per-file isolation via scripts/run_tests_parallel.py — each test
#     file runs in its own freshly-spawned `python -m pytest <file>`
#     subprocess. No xdist, no shared workers, no module-level leakage
#     between files.
#   * TZ=UTC, LANG=C.UTF-8, PYTHONHASHSEED=0 (deterministic)
#   * Env vars blanked (conftest.py also does this, but this
#     is belt-and-suspenders for anyone running pytest outside our
#     conftest path — e.g. on a single file)
#   * Proper venv activation (probes .venv, venv, then ~/.hermes/...)
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/run_tests.sh                            # full suite
#   scripts/run_tests.sh -j 4                       # cap parallelism
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/agent/               # discover only here
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/agent/ tests/acp/    # multiple roots
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/foo.py               # single file
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/foo.py -q            # path + bare pytest flag
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/foo.py -v --tb=long  # bare flags "just work"
#   scripts/run_tests.sh -k 'pattern'               # value flags pass through too
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/foo.py -- --tb=long  # explicit '--' still works
#
# Bare pytest flags (anything starting with '-' that isn't one of this
# runner's own options: -j/--jobs, --paths, --slice, --file-timeout, etc.)
# are forwarded to each per-file pytest invocation automatically — no '--'
# separator required. The explicit '--' form still works and stacks with
# bare flags. Positional path arguments override the default discovery
# root (tests/).
#
# ── Running tests/hermes_cli (and why through here) ─────────────────────────
#
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/hermes_cli -j 6
#
# This script is THE checkpoint runner for that directory, and a red is
# defined as "any FILE red under it". Running `pytest tests/hermes_cli`
# directly asks a different question: 568 files then share one interpreter,
# and ~41 failures appear in test_web_server_* / test_web_ui_build.py that are
# green when each file is run alone (ledger row F3). That is module-level
# state leaking across files — the exact thing per-file spawning exists to
# prevent — so it is a fact about the interpreter, not a defect in those
# tests, and it is not being chased (ML-7 / operator ruling R-e, 2026-08-18).
#
# If this script refuses with "no virtualenv with pytest found", it means
# every candidate venv either does not exist or has no pytest INSTALLED —
# an empty `.venv/` directory counts as the former. Point it at a real one:
#
#   HERMES_PYTHON=/c/Python312/python.exe scripts/run_tests.sh tests/hermes_cli
#
# Refusing is deliberate; a venv without pytest reports "0 tests passed",
# which reads green at a glance.

# reported "0 tests passed" (which reads green at a glance even though the

# and tempfile needs TEMP/TMP. Dropping them breaks collection on native

# credentials, so forwarding them keeps the isolation intent intact. Each is
# only forwarded when actually set, so POSIX runs are byte-for-byte unchanged.

# The Windows platform vars below are opt-in for the same reason PATH/HOME are:
# they are not credentials, they are how the OS answers "where is the user, and
# where is scratch space". Without USERPROFILE/LOCALAPPDATA/APPDATA, CPython's
# ``Path.home()`` has nothing to resolve against and every import that touches
# it dies at COLLECTION time — a baseline run on Windows reported ~56 files
# failing for reasons no source change caused, which makes the failure-set diff
# (the only honest "is this mine?" signal) unreadable. SYSTEMROOT is required by
# the socket/ssl/subprocess machinery on Windows, and TEMP/TMP keep tempfile off
# a fabricated path. All six are absent-safe: `${VAR:+VAR="$VAR"}` expands to
# nothing on POSIX, so Linux/macOS/CI runs are byte-for-byte unchanged.
#
# SYSTEMROOT is read UPPERCASE on purpose. Windows treats env var names as
# case-insensitive; the shell reading them here does not. git-bash exports the
# variable as `SYSTEMROOT`, so the mixed-case `${SystemRoot:+…}` this line used
# to carry expanded to NOTHING and the var was silently dropped from the
# hermetic env — the exact class of dead guard it was written to prevent. The
# child is still handed it under the spelling Windows itself uses.
